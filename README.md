You can also use Shuv on the command line. Run shuv.sh (or shuv.bat) to see how!

# How It Works

It's simple! Most modern file-sharing services use server storage, which is sadly finite. With those, you have to worry about how much stuff you've uploaded. That's no good at all! Shuv has a simple solution: Instead of putting files in a file system, Shuv puts them into the infinite power of the URL.

By creating a URL that represents your files, Shuv can just give you the URL to share with your friends! To make your data even more portable, Shuv uses the power of a link shortener service to turn your long URL into a small Shuv Code! It's practically magic!
